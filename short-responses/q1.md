# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
The difference is that controllers mainly request logic and return responses while middleware functions do what controllers do and additionally can also parse requests and perform server-side actions.

Not quite. Controllers parse requests, perform server side actions, and send back responses.

Middleware also parse requests and can perform server side actions, but they don't send responses. Instead, they pass control along to the next middleware/controller function in the chain.
